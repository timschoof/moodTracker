# moodTracker

This is a Shiny web application that allows you to track your mood over time. 
You can record your mood, on a scale from 1 to 5 (from frowny to smiley). 
The data are saved in a locally stored excel spreadsheet. You can also plot 
your mood data over time, by day of the week, time of day, or by date. 

Note that the app runs locally on your own computer because you don't necessarily 
want other people to know what mood you're in!

You can run the application by clicking the 'Run App' button in RStudio. 
Before you run the app for the first time, specify the directory where you want to save your Mood data and the filename
of the csv file you want to store the data in (see the "CHANGE THIS SECTION 
BEFORE YOU START" section in app.R).
